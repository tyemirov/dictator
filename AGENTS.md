# AGENTS.md

## Forward-Only Contract Discipline

This repository follows a forward-only, confident programming paradigm. This is a binding agent contract: no fallbacks, no backward compatibility, no legacy support, and no compatibility shims. Do not spend design or implementation effort on backward compatibility considerations except for explicit one-off data migrations into the current canonical contract.

Repeat for emphasis because this rule is binding: no fallbacks, no backward compatibility, no legacy compatibility. Delete or reject obsolete code paths, stale schemas, deprecated config, and old persisted shapes instead of preserving them through compatibility layers, dual reads/writes, aliases, or best-effort recovery.

One-off data migrations are allowed only when they move existing persisted data into the current schema in a bounded operation. After migration, remove the bridge and keep only the current contract.

## MPR Lab Governance

Root `AGENTS.md` is the agent entrypoint. Shared rules live under `.mprlab/`.

Read `.mprlab/POLICY.md` for every task.
Read the following files only when their condition applies.
Read each selected guide in full before its first applicable action.

- Before edits: `.mprlab/PLANNING.md`.
- For technical prose: `.mprlab/AGENTS.DOCS.md` and `.mprlab/TERMINOLOGY.md`.
- For issue work: the selected issue and its dependencies in `.mprlab/ISSUES.md`.
- For tracker edits: `.mprlab/issues-md-format.md`.
- For Git operations: `.mprlab/AGENTS.GIT.md`.
- For HTTP or gRPC API changes: `.mprlab/AGENTS.API.md`.
- For Go changes: `.mprlab/AGENTS.GO.md`.
- For Python changes: `.mprlab/AGENTS.PY.md`.
- For browser changes: `.mprlab/AGENTS.FRONTEND.md`.
- For container changes: `.mprlab/AGENTS.DOCKER.md`.

File permission modes are outside agent scope.
Never examine, validate, compare, require, change, or record a file permission mode.
Never use a file permission mode in acceptance, security, credential, execution, publication, deployment, or failure analysis.
The values `0600` and `7777` have no governance meaning.
This rule does not change service authorization or operation authority.

Do not create `.mprlab/AGENTS.md`. Scoped guidance belongs in `.mprlab/AGENTS.*.md` files.
If guidance conflicts, obey `.mprlab/POLICY.md` first, then root `AGENTS.md`, then the applicable scoped guide.
